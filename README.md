It utilizes a **MySQL** database with **Prisma ORM** for data management, and incorporates various frontend libraries like **Bootstrap**, **Zustand**, **Formik**, and **react-confetti** for a dynamic user experience.

## Features

- **JWT-based authentication** with **Passport.js** for secure user login and registration.
- **User sessions** and authentication state management with **Zustand**.
- **Responsive UI** using **React Bootstrap**.
- **Form handling** with **Formik** for smoother user input and validation.
- **Email notifications** via **EmailJS**.
- Fun **confetti effect** using **react-confetti** for user interactions (e.g., on successful registration).
